## Shoot-and-Save-Multiplayer-Game
I did this project in my Level-1/Term-2. <br>
This is a multiplayer game implemented with __Java networking__.<br>
Two computers from same network can play this game. One will try to score by shooting and another will try to save.<br>
The shooter can control the height, swing and speed in shooting. 
The goalkeeper can save using mouse.
